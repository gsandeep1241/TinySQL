Queries not working:

SELECT * FROM course WHERE exam + homework = 200
SELECT * FROM course WHERE NOT exam = 0
SELECT * FROM course WHERE [ exam = 100 OR homework = 100 ] AND project = 100
SELECT * FROM course WHERE ( exam * 30 + homework * 20 + project * 50 ) / 100 = 100
SELECT * FROM course WHERE grade = "C" AND [ exam > 70 OR project > 70 ] AND NOT ( exam * 30 + homework * 20 + project * 50 ) / 100 < 60
SELECT * FROM course, course2 WHERE course.sid = course2.sid AND [ course.exam = 100 OR course2.exam = 100 ]
SELECT * FROM course, course2 WHERE course.sid = course2.sid AND [ course.exam > course2.exam OR course.homework = 100 ]
SELECT DISTINCT course.grade, course2.grade FROM course, course2 WHERE course.sid = course2.sid AND [ course.exam > course2.exam OR course.grade = "A" AND course2.grade = "A" ] ORDER BY course.exam


Yet to implement:
  1. One pass Join, Two pass join improvement? Product?
